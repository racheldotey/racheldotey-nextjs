Hello there, fellow human!

My name is Rachel, and I'm the carbon-based life form who generated this
website. When I'm not busy building apps, I enjoy doing other earthly things
like taking walks in the park, binge-watching Netflix shows, and eating
delicious human foods.

As an anthropoid, I take pride in creating websites that are user-friendly
and visually appealing. I also believe in the power of humor and try to
inject it into my work whenever possible.

Thank you for taking the time to read this humans.txt file and learn a
little more about me. Let's all continue to embrace our humanity and make
the most of our time on this beautiful planet.

Have a great rotation of Earth!
- Rachel
